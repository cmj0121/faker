# Faker #
The structure-based faker data generator.

## Basic ##
The basic fake data is `in`t and `float64` which is generated by the Random interface.

## Random ##
The random interface is provide the random data with specified `Seed`. By-default the faker will
call the Seed twice when load a new Random which first-time pass the time.Now().UnixNano() and
then pass the result for the Int63()
